# erw-bash-commons

Some bash libraries and scripts.

Please see the documentation at https://erwanm.github.io/erw-bash-commons/

## Common Practice

a common practice is:

1. to source the `lib/init-erw-pm.sh` first in `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` first.
2. use `erw-pm` to add your repositories according to the `setup.erw-pm.sh` provided inside the repositories.

a example of `~/.bashrc` is provided [here](https://github.com/erwanm/erw-setup/blob/master/bashrc).
